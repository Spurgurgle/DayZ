Source_Car

Ive made this set of files as a reference, learning aid/tool and just generally a useful set of files for the modding community. I hope other will help and contribute to the Source Car. 
I believe people can start a 2nd branch and I can merge the 2 branches (im new to github so not 100% sure on how it all works yet). Adding anything will be helpfull, extra comments to explain variables and sections of the vehicle, tweaks to the model/textures/rvmats and any of the files that help improve them,  Anything you want to contribute.
If you do contribute please add your name into the main Config.cpp under credits. 

My aim with these files is to try and make a solid set of sample files for Dayz cars/vehicles. Everything in these files are subject to change and improvement.


Things to note.!!!

When you extract your game files there is no Driver or passenger proxy. These are simply empty p3d's.
Please make them before trying to pack you mod.
\dz\vehicles\proxies\bus_driver.p3d
\dz\vehicles\proxies\bus_cargo.p3d
